## A Day in the Life
I consider myself lucky to not be as impacted as some others. Most of my hobbies are indoors, and the golf course I work at, mysteriously, is considered essential enough to remain operational. I'm very comfortable with the idea of social distancing. While I certainly miss going out for a swim, or some non-essential shopping, I don't mind doing without that for a while. I can imagine that changing pretty quickly if the situation stays as it is, but for now, things aren't too different for me. If anything, there's less work than there is before. The weekly 10 hours of bus commute to Manoa has been cut from my schedule. At work, social distancing efforts mean most of my duties attending to guests are not only no longer required, but actively prohibited. The lack of responsibility should make life smooth sailing, but the situation definitely poses other problems to rock the boat.

## Help!
Both my classes I have this semester take the flipped classroom approach. All the lectures are online, so moving the rest of class online isn't the most difficult change. All the information I need to learn is there, and I'm very thankful the class transition was as seamless as it is. But while the class work hasn't changed much, the mentality towards it certainly has. There's a certain "switch" that get's flipped in your head simply being on campus. From having to get ready for the commute, to making sure you're prepared for the upcoming quiz. Class provides a set time each week you know you'll be doing work. With that schedule gone, a very different approach known as "I'll do it later" can creep in to replace that schedule. I happen to have a lot of experience with that work approach.

<b>It doesn't work.</b>

This is probably the most dangerous part of the situation (besides the virus of course). My internal habits to procrastinate combined with the external motivators suddenly gone, create a big challenge to face. It's easy to not sleep in class, but a little harder when "class" is your comfy bed. You know you can get that quiz done when you take your seat, but might miss it when it's due "sometime today". The biggest change for me to be successful moving forward is facing that problem.

## I Will...
An artist I follow shared some valuable insight on dealing with these problems. If the external cues are no longer there, you can make them yourself. Do schoolwork in a different room than where you play. Change out of your pajamas, even if you aren't leaving home. Anything to flip that switch in your brain to work mode. It's been a lot of help to me. Having a final project be group work is also very helpful. Not letting your group down is stressful, but maybe the correct amount of stress needed in these times.

## We Can Work it Out
While I'm sad from the impact the virus has on the world, and afraid of risk it brings to some friends and family, I'm thankful for the self reflection it brought along. The gamer cave I spend all my time in starts to feel like a golden cage when you can't leave it. After all this is over, more time outside would be appreciated. And if I can push through all this, maybe I'll have some antibodies to the lazy virus that's been plaguing me for years.
